## Summary

Building on the foundations of well test metering uncertainty analysis, this project quantified the benefit of relocating a test separator from a decommissioned drillsite to another location lacking proper test equipment. By combining the uncertainty model with a gas lift optimization workflow, the analysis demonstrated the value of improved metering for daily field optimization and supported the decision to execute the relocation.

## Project Highlights

- Integrated uncertainty quantification with a simple gas lift optimization model to assess the impact of metering error on field operations
- Modeled the effect of improved measurement accuracy on daily optimization outcomes
- Provided a data-driven justification for relocating the test separator and measurement equipment
- Supported operational decision making and resource allocation for field metering improvements

## Technical Innovation

- Combined uncertainty modeling and optimization to quantify the operational value of improved metering
- Developed analytical workflows to simulate optimization scenarios under varying measurement error
- Enabled more effective daily optimization by reducing uncertainty in production data

## Impact

The project directly informed the relocation of a test separator and associated measurement equipment, improving metering accuracy and enabling more effective daily optimization. The approach provided a clear, quantitative rationale for equipment investment and laid the groundwork for future metering prioritization and optimization initiatives.
