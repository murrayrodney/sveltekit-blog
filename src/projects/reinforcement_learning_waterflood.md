# Summary

Reinforcement learning for waterflood optimization is one of our flagship applications of artificial intelligence technologies in petroleum engineering. This project utilized reinforcement learning algorithms with a custom-built environment to interact with based on a simple reservoir model to optimize waterflood operations. The end result was a 300 bopd increase in production for a field originally producing 1000 bopd resulting in a $9 million increase in annual revenue.

## Project Highlights

- Implemented a custom RL environment based on a capacitance resistance model to reflect the reservoir
- Implemented state-of-the-art RL algorithms for decision-making in waterflood operations including injection rates and producer status
- Insights from RL recommendations resulting in a $9 million increase in revenue

## Technical Innovation

The project introduced several technical innovations:
