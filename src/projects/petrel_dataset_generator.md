## Summary

Collaborated with reservoir engineers to develop an automated process for extracting essential data from company databases and constructing specialized input files for Petrel and Intersect reservoir simulation software. The workflow generates files for production, layer activity, and wellbore trajectories in the required formats, enabling seamless data transfer and rapid model setup.

## Project Highlights

- Automated extraction and transformation of production, layer activity, and wellbore trajectory data
- Generated simulation-ready files in formats compatible with Petrel and Intersect
- Reduced manual data preparation effort and improved data consistency
- Enabled faster onboarding and adoption of SLB's Petrel and Intersect after transitioning from the company's internal simulator

## Technical Innovation

- Designed a flexible data integration pipeline to support evolving simulation requirements
- Ensured compatibility with Petrel/Intersect file standards for direct model loading
- Streamlined collaboration between data engineering and reservoir simulation teams

## Impact

The Petrel dataset generator accelerated the transition to industry-standard reservoir simulation tools, reducing manual data preparation and improving data quality. The automated workflow enabled engineers to quickly build and update simulation models, supporting more efficient reservoir management and analysis.
