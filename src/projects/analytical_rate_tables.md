## Summary

This project introduced a simple, interpretable analytical solution for estimating well performance in the Greater Kuparuk Area, replacing complex and time-intensive workflows for many wells. The approach leverages simple equations that can be easily fit to production data, particularly for wells with stable waterflood history and a series of step rate tests to establish the effect of different gas lift rates and wellhead pressures. This solution has proven highly effective for routine optimization and analysis, saving 40-60 hours per month and providing more accurate well performance estimates.

## Project Highlights

- Developed a streamlined workflow for analytical well performance curves, enabling rapid analysis for most Kuparuk wells
- Implemented the solution in a SvelteKit app, providing a modern, interactive user experience and learning the framework in the process
- Backend optimization and curve fitting powered by FastAPI for scalable, responsive performance
- Integrated with Snowflake and dbt to merge analytical curves with the existing system, ensuring continued support for complex or specialized wells

## Technical Innovation

- Replaced legacy, computation-heavy workflows with a simple, closed-form analytical approach
- Leveraged step rate test data to calibrate well models and optimize gas lift rates
- Combined modern web technologies (SvelteKit, FastAPI) with enterprise data tools (Snowflake, dbt) for seamless integration and scalability

## Impact

The new workflow has transformed well performance analysis for the Greater Kuparuk Area, enabling engineers to quickly and accurately estimate production rates and optimize operations. The integration with existing systems ensures that both routine and specialized wells are supported, while the adoption of SvelteKit and FastAPI has set a new standard for flexibility and interactivity in engineering applications.
