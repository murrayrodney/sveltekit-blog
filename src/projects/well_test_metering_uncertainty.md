## Summary

This project focused on quantifying uncertainty in well test measurements, with a particular emphasis on watercut meter error at well testing facilities. The analysis demonstrated the significant impact of metering error on field-level production estimates and explored Bayesian methods to integrate multiple measurements across the field production network, improving the estimation of actual production rates.

## Project Highlights

- Analyzed error in watercut meters and its effect on well test and field analysis
- Explored Bayesian approaches to combine measurements from different locations in the production network for more accurate rate estimation
- Provided recommendations to inform metering calibration guidelines and highlighted the value of maintaining high-quality field metering
- Laid the foundation for future metering related efforts

## Technical Innovation

- Applied Bayesian inference to quantify uncertainty and integrate hierarchical measurement data
- Demonstrated the impact of metering error on field analysis and decision making
- Developed analytical workflows to support calibration and metering prioritization

## Impact

Although the project was sidelined due to shifting priorities, it provided valuable insights into the importance of metering accuracy and calibration. The work established a foundation for future work and operational decisions.
