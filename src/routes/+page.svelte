<h2>Engineer/Data Scientist</h2>

<p>
	I am a data scientist who started off as a petroleum engineer in Alaska after graduating from the
	University of Wyoming with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After working as an engineer for
	several years I discovered my love for working with data problems which lead me to a data science
	based role (Data Analytics Engineer in our company). After several months of working in that
	position and recognizing an opportunity to build a better foundation in statistics I began the
	Master of Applied Statistics program from Colorado State University.
</p>
